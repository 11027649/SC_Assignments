# Set 1
## Setup
Download the folder from GitHub. For all the necessary packages, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Vibrating string
* A. For the equation, see the report.
* B. Run ```python vibrating_string.py```
* C. Run ```python vibrating_string_animation.py``` with the right method. Videos of the animated plot can be found in the results folder.

## Diffusion run information
* D. For the equation, see the report
* E. Run ```python diffusion_time_dependent.py```
* F. Run ```python diffusion_time_dependent.py```
* G. Run ```python diffusion_animation.py```
* H. Run ```python diffusion_show_convergence.py```
* I. Run ```python diffusion_show_convergence.py```
* J. Run ```python diffusion_optimum_omega_sor.py``` to get the data and create your own omega_results.csv (be sure to delete the old one), and ```python diffusion_plot_opt_omega_sor.py``` to plot the data in the omega_results.csv file that is in this folder.
* K. Run ```python diffusion_with_objects.py``` for an example. You can add objects by giving the add_object function different coordinates and sizes for the object.
