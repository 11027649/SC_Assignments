Scientific Computing Assignments
All the algorithms and programs in these problem sets are developed for the course Scientific Computing in the master Computational Science at the UvA february/march 2019.

## Set 1: Vibrating string, Time dependent diﬀusion, Jacobi iteration, Gauss-Seidel iteration, Successive overrelaxation
This set contains some programs that can be used to solve the partial differential equations of the Wave Equation and the Diffusion Equation. For more detailed information, we'd like to refer to the Readme and our report, both included in the Set 1 folder.

## Set 2: Diﬀusion-limited aggregation, Random walk, Reaction-Diﬀusion System

## Set 3: Eigenmodes of a circular drum, Direct methods
