# Set 2
## Setup
Download the folder from GitHub. For all the necessary packages, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

For the randomWalker we implemented the placing of the walker near the object to speed up the calculations (since it took the walker forever to reach the object for the first time).

## Diffusion Limited Aggregation
* A. Run ```python dla_run.py```

## Monte Carlo simulation of DLA
* B. Run ```python randomwalker_run.py``` with p_stick = 1
* C. Run ```python vibrating_string_animation.py``` with the right p_stick.

## The Gray-Scott model - A reaction-diffusion system
* D. Run ```python grayscott_run.py```
